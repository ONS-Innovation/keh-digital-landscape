# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard provides administrative tools for managing site-wide banners and technology reference data.

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard allows authorised users to manage system-wide settings and maintain technology reference lists. This interface offers advanced tools for administrators to shape the technology landscape by defining the technology taxonomy, managing notification banners, and normalising technology names across projects.

## Features

### Banner Management
- Create, toggle, and delete site-wide notification banners
- Configure banner properties (title, message, type)
- Select target pages for each banner 
- Preview banner appearance before deployment

### Technology Reference Management
- View categorised technology reference lists
- Add, edit, and remove technologies in each category
- Alphabetical and length-based sorting options
- Import and normalise technologies from project data

### Technology Audit Tool
- Detect untracked technologies used in projects
- Identify similar technologies with configurable similarity threshold
- Merge or normalise technology names to ensure consistency
- Track technology usage across projects

## Usage

### Managing Banners
1. Enter banner title and message
2. Select banner type (info, warning, or error)
3. Choose target pages for the banner to appear
4. Save the banner to make it active
5. Toggle banner visibility or delete as needed

### Technology Reference Lists
1. Select a category to view or edit its technologies
2. Add new technologies with the "Add Technology" button
3. Edit or remove existing technologies as needed
4. Sort the list alphabetically or by length
5. Save changes to persist modifications

### Normalising Technologies
1. In the "Untracked Technologies" section, locate inconsistent technology names
2. Click the normalise button for a technology
3. Select the canonical version or enter a custom name
4. View affected projects before confirming
5. Apply normalisation to update all project references

### Technology Similarity Detection
1. Adjust the similarity threshold slider as needed
2. Review potential matches in the untracked technologies list
3. Click on the match count to view similar technologies
4. Select the correct version to normalise or standardise names
5. Confirm changes to update affected projects

## Technology Management Workflow

The admin interface provides a comprehensive workflow for maintaining technology records:

1. **Discovery**: Identify untracked or inconsistently named technologies
2. **Review**: Examine similar technologies and decide on canonical naming
3. **Normalisation**: Update technology names across all projects
4. **Categorisation**: Add technologies to appropriate reference lists
5. **Publication**: Make technologies available in the Tech Radar for review

This workflow ensures consistency in technology tracking, improves data quality, and enables accurate technology governance across the organisation.
