An example of this is R for statistical analysis, which is widely used and encouraged within Data Science teams but should be avoided in other directorates (i.e. Digital Services).</p> <p>When it comes to creating radar views for directorates, Digital Services is used as a default view if other directorates have no specific technology positions.
