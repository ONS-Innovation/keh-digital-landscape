# Playwright & Axe-Core Testing

WCAG means the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. By default, the tests run the latest version of WCAG2.0 and WCAG2.1. To run different tests, you can use specific tags when running with `node test.js {tag1} {tag2}`. You can view all compatible axe-core tags [here](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/#axecore-tags).

## Prerequisities

1. App is running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Node and npm are installed

## Installation

Install dependencies and playwright browsers:

```bash
make setup
```

## Running

The tests will run over the pages defined in the `pages` array in `test.js`. If you want to run the tests over a different set of pages, you can do so by changing the `pages` array.

Run the default `wcag2a wcag2aa wcag21a wcag21aa` tests after setting up:

```bash
make test
```

Reports will be generated in `testing/reports/{timestamp of run}`.

An individual JSON file with the full axe scan is outputted here. e.g. `JSON/report-{page}.json`.

For an easier to read version of the whole app scan, see the `report.html` and `report.md`.

To view examples of the layout, see `/testing/example_reports` where a `report.html` and `report.md` are generated.

### Testing authenticated routes

Some routes require authentication (like `/copilot/team`). For these routes, you need to provide a GitHub token as an environment variable.

1. Go to the copilot team page:

```http
http://localhost:3000/copilot/team
```

2. Click the "Login with GitHub" button.

3. You will be redirected to the GitHub login page. Login with your GitHub account.

4. You will be redirected back to the copilot team page.

5. Open Chrome DevTools and navigate to the "Application" tab.

6. Under "Cookies", find the "githubUserToken" cookie.

7. Copy the `value` of the cookie, beginning with `ghu_`.

8. Set the environment variable before running tests:

```bash
export TEST_GITHUBUSERTOKEN="your-generated-token"
export TEST_GITHUBTEAM="your-team-slug"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the `testing/frontend` directory with:

```bash
TEST_GITHUBUSERTOKEN=your-generated-token
TEST_GITHUBTEAM=your-team-slug
```

9. Run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

Routes that require authentication are marked with `"authenticated": "githubUserToken"` in `test-config.json`.

### Testing specific tags

Alternatively, you can run the tests with all available axe-core tags:

```bash
make test-all
```

Please note that this will most likely throw a lot of moderate and minor violations that don't need to be fixed.

You can also test specific tags by running:

```bash
node test.js {tag1} {tag2}
```

## Axe DevTools

Whilst this is automated testing, it can be easier to install the free axe DevTools Chrome extension to run scans directly in the browser. Although, you cannot generate reports from the free version of the extension, so reports can be generated here.

Download the extension from [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd).

## UI Tests

The UI tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and are located in the `testing/frontend/tests` directory. These tests are designed to verify the application's user interface and user flows, including both general UI and accessibility checks.

### **Test Structure**

- **Test Files:**  
  All UI test scripts are located in `testing/frontend/tests`. Each file typically targets a specific feature or page (e.g., `review.test.js`, `search.test.js`).

- **Test Data:**  
  Test data used by the UI tests is stored in the `testing/frontend/data` directory. This data is loaded and used to mock API responses, ensuring tests are deterministic and not dependent on live backend data.

- **Mocking API Calls:**  
  Playwrightâ€™s [`route.fulfill`](https://playwright.dev/docs/network#handle-requests) function is used to intercept and mock API requests. This allows the tests to simulate various backend responses and edge cases without requiring changes to the backend or test environment.

- **Test Configuration:**  
  The `test-config.json` file defines which routes require authentication and other test-specific settings. Routes that require authentication are marked with `"authenticated": "githubUserToken"`.

- **Reports:**  
  After running the tests, reports are generated in the `testing/reports/{timestamp}` directory. These include both JSON and human-readable HTML/Markdown summaries.

### **Test Coverage**

Run the following to run the tests:

```bash
make test-ui
```

## Cleaning

After tests have finished, remove the `/reports` and `/test-results` folders by using:

```bash
make clean
```
